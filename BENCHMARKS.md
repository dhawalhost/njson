## Performance Characteristics

### njson Strengths

1. **Filter Operations**: Exceptional performance (382x faster than gjson)
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Consistently lower memory usage across all operations
3. **Simple Operations**: Excellent performance for common use cases
4. **DELETE Optimization**: Now competitive for simple deletions (7% faster than sjson)
5. **SET Operations**: Strong performance with significant memory savings

### njson Areas for Improvement

1. **Large Deep Queries**: Performance regression for very deep paths in large documents
2. **Complex DELETE Operations**: Falls back to slower generic path for nested/array deletions
3. **Deep Object Creation**: Creating very deep nested structures could be optimized

### Library Comparison

#### When to Use njson
- **Filter operations** (416x faster than alternatives)
- **Memory-constrained environments** (50-75% less memory usage)
- **Simple to medium complexity operations**
- **Applications requiring good all-around performance**

#### When to Consider Alternatives
- **gjson**: For very deep path queries in large documents
- **sjson**: For complex DELETE operations requiring maximum speed

go test -bench=BenchmarkGet_SimpleSmall -benchmem -cpuprofile=cpu.prof
```

## Performance Tips

### For Maximum GET Performance

1. Use simple dot notation when possible
2. Avoid very deep paths in large documents
3. Prefer specific paths over wildcard queries when you know the exact field
4. Use `GetMany()` for multiple field access

### For Maximum SET Performance

1. Use simple field updates rather than complex nested creation
2. Batch multiple updates when possible
3. Consider using `SetWithOptions` with `MergeObjects: false` for better performance
4. Pre-compile paths for repeated operations using `CompileSetPath()`

### For Memory Efficiency

1. Use `Result.Raw` for string access to avoid allocations
2. Reuse byte slices when possible
3. Avoid unnecessary string conversions
4. Process results immediately rather than storing them

### Overall Assessment

njson excels as a **well-rounded, memory-efficient** JSON library that:

- **Dominates filter operations** with unprecedented performance
- **Provides excellent memory efficiency** across all operations
- **Offers competitive performance** for most common use cases
- **Maintains safety and correctness** by falling back to generic paths when needed

The library is ideal for applications prioritizing both performance and memory efficiency, particularly those involving complex filtering operations or operating in memory-constrained environments.
